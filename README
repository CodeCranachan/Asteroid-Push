**ASTEROID PUSH**

To get this compiled and running you will need the following: 
- JDK 7 
- Apache Maven 3.1.1 (I guess what matters is that it supports POM 4.0.0)
- slick2d-maven from GitHub (https://github.com/nguillaumin/slick2d-maven)

The slick2d developers have not yet deemed it necessary to migrate to maven, making our lives needlessly difficult.
To get the build to work you will need to clone slick2d-maven to your local drive, and then run 'mvn clean install' on it.

Once you have everything installed you can package the game using 'mvn package'.
