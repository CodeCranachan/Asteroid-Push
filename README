* ASTEROID PUSH *

At the moment there are only two things you need to install in order to get this compiled and running: 
- JDK 7 
- Apache Ant 1.8.2 (others might work as well, but that is what I am using)
Everything else is bundled in the repository.

Configure your environment variables so JAVA_HOME points to your JDK and ANT_HOME points to the ant installation and add the ant's bin directory to your path.

Then execute ant run in the directory you found this file. This compiles, tests, packs and then starts the game


I apologize for the current lack of proper credit giving to the developers of the libraries I am using. I will remedy the situation once the project gets really going.
